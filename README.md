# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview of Vine Analysis
The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews to determine if there is bias towards reviews of Vine members (paid reviews).  For this dataset, I used toy reviews as my dataset.

**##Summary **
There doesn't appear to be a great bias towards positive reviews based on whether respondents were paid as the percentages of 5 star reviews for paid reviews was only 40% and the 5 star ratings for unpaid reviews was 63%.   

Additional items to check:
1.  However, because the number of paid reviews was so small in comparison to non-paid reviews, we could increase our sample size (more years, etc.) to have more data to analyze.  
2.  I would aldo be interested to see if there are any trends in the paid 5 star reviews, including one person doing more multiple reviews, etc.  
3.  I would also look at about 5-10 additional data sets perform similar calculations.
