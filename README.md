# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview of Vine Analysis
The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews to determine if there is bias towards reviews of Vine members (paid reviews).  For this dataset, I used toy reviews as my dataset.  
## Results

6.  % of Non-Vine Reviews that were 5 stars:



##Summary 
There doesn't appear to be a great bias towards positive reviews based on whether respondents were paid as the percentages were 40% compared to 63%.  

Additional items to check:
1.  However, because the number of paid reviews was so small in comparison to non-paid reviews, we could increase our sample size (more years, etc.) to better understand if we can make that determination.  
2.  I would aldo be interested to see if there are any trends in the paid 5 star reviews, including one person doing more multiple reviews, etc.  
3.  I would also look at about 5-10 additional data sets perform similar calculations.
